# ChestX-ray14 Multi-Modal Deep Learning

This project explores the integration of tabular patient data with deep learning models for chest X-ray classification using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We compare CNN and Vision Transformer architectures with two different methods of tabular data integration.

Will update this README with more details about the project.
