# ChestXR14 Deep Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on deep learning applications for the ChestX-ray14 dataset (ChestXR14), a large public dataset of chest X-ray images. The project is part of the CS7643 Deep Learning course.

## Dataset
The ChestXR14 dataset contains 112,120 frontal CXR images from 30,805 unique patients. Each image is labeled with up to 14 different thoracic pathology labels and is thus a multi-label classification task.

## Environment Setup
Install the dependencies using the environment.yml file.
